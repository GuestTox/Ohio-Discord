# What is Ohio discord?

Discord but from Ohio.

# Can I use it?

Didn't implement internet stuff since I don't have a dedicated server. So it only works locally.

I have made a HOWTOUSE.txt file on how to connect other computers connected to the same WIFI/ROUTER.

# Are you gonna update it?

No, I will make it into a website to make it easy to connect. So, this will stay as it is.
